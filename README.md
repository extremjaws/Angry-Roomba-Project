# Angry-Roomba-Project
An angry roomba is chasing you through a defense roomba factory. 
(bad) storyline:
You are in a roomba factory that makes roombas for home security. You were not working fast enough, so your boss decided it would be a good idea to lock you in at night. 
Now, you have to escape and not work there anymore.

Good luck!
